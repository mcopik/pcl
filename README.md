Point Cloud Library (PCL)

This is a fork from offical pcl repository.
It contains minor modifications which allow running modified nonrigid ICP algorithm.
It will also have a bunch of helpful Matlab scripts.

Authors:  Dominik Spinczyk, Adam Karwan, Marcin Copik

Branches:
- master - not finished implementation which is compatible with newest PCL; refactored, clean, commented and nice ;-)
- old - old version based on PCL 1.3

The Point Cloud Library (PCL) is a standalone, large scale, open project for 2D/3D image and point cloud processing.

PCL is released under the terms of the BSD license, and thus free for commercial and research use. We are financially supported by a consortium of commercial companies, with our own non-profit organization, Open Perception. We would also like to thank individual donors and contributors that have been helping the project.
