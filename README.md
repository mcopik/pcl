Point Cloud Library (PCL)

This is a fork from offical pcl repository.
It contains minor modifications which allow running modified nonrigid ICP algorithm.
It will also have a bunch of helpful Matlab scripts.

Branches:
- master - not finished implementation which is compatible with newest PCL; refactored, clean, commented and nice ;-)
- old - old version based on PCL 1.3
